Pure gas adsorption Microporosity of Zn-datz-ipa@SiO 2 @TIFSIX-2-Cu-i was established by 77 K N 2 sorption experiments, which gives a typical type-I characteristic. A difference between adsorption and desorption isotherms of an adsorbate-adsorbent system is referred to as sorption hysteresis. ... The absence of mixed-gas adsorption studies as competitive adsorption effects is recommended for consideration in future studies. In addition, the varying pore size of graphite should be in the context of pure ... Which of the following statements describes a difference between a mixture and a pure substance? The composition of a mixture can vary from sample to sample, but the composition of a pure substance is always the same. ... The tower separates it into less dense chemicals like butane and gasoline, and more dense chemicals like diesel fuel and tar ..."

      "subquery": "How does the dual-mode sorption model work in predicting mixed-gas sorption behavior in glassy polymers?",
      "results": "The dual-mode theory became a de facto standard for the description of sorption data for glassy polymers and the combination of the three parameters has been determined for a broad range of systems. 4 A typical shape of dual-mode sorption isotherm together with the two contributions is shown in Fig. 1 (black, red, and blue solid lines). In view of the physically sounding ideas it is founded on, as well of its simplicity and stand-alone character, the dual-mode sorption model (DMS) has been almost universally used in past decades to analyze and compare gas sorption data in polymeric matrixes below the glass transition temperature. The elements the DMS analysis is based on are here revised with the help of results developed ... Moreover, the Dual Mode Sorption (DMS) model and the partial immobilization model were used to describe the sorption and transport properties of CO 2 /CH 4 mixtures in the studied glassy polymer membrane. The models enable the identification and explanation of the solubility and diffusion phenomena accompanying the permeation of the main biogas ... While sorption models for glassy polymers are well-established, they often deviate from observed mixture data. ... (i.e., single- and mixed-gas sorption of CO 2 /CH 4 in a fluorinated polyimide and CH 4 /H 2 in a polymer of intrinsic microporosity) and three popular mixture sorption models (the Dual-Mode Sorption model, Non-Equilibrium ... They note that membrane performance for mixed-gas feeds cannot be fully predicted from their pure-gas permeation properties. This result is closely related to observations of glassy polymers showing accelerated or altered physical aging via plasticization, antiplasticization, and/or competitive dual mode effects in mixed-gas permeation experiments."

The experimental sorption isotherms of both gases were used to determine the coefficients of the Dual Mode Sorption model, which enables theoretical prediction of the solubility of CO 2 and CH 4 in the pure and mixed state. The physical plausibility of the model coefficients was justified on the basis of such premises as their consistency for ... The actual trends are shown in the figures below for the full pyrolysis temperature range from 550 to 900 °C. The dual mode model parameters allows directly probing the physical basis for the above trend using corresponding plots of the dual mode sorption parameters k C,i C L, i ′ and b i parameters in Eq. (3) for CO 2 and CH 4. However, through a mixed gas dual mode sorption model developed by Koros, CO 2 and CH 4 sorption isotherms (Figure S6, Supporting Information) of the four membranes under 20/80 binary CO 2 /CH 4 mixture were predicted using the dual mode sorption parameters in Table S4 (Supporting Information)."

Furthermore, we show that sorption data (e.g., high-pressure data), able to capture intrinsic isotherm nonlinearities of sorption models, are critical to considerably improve parameter inference from collective model-data fits and thus accurately predict mixture sorption. Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends inside both types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical structures. The present model can reduce the dynamic responses to the multi-component target analytes observed in the experimental signal responses. Moreover, the use of optimized fitting parameters extracted from pure vapors with viscoelastic parameters allows us to predict the concentration of each analyte in the multi-component system."

Nanoporous adsorbent materials are a key part of many industrial processes, including the rapidly expanding carbon capture industry. The development of advanced sorbents requires an assessment of the sorbent's performance under mixed-gas conditions.
