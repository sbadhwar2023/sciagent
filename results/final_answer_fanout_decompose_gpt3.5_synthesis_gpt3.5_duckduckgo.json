  "final_answer": "### Differences Between Pure- and Mixed-Gas Sorption for Glassy Polymers\n\nIn glassy polymers, pure-gas sorption involves the interaction of a single gas species with the polymer matrix, while mixed-gas sorption involves multiple gas species interacting simultaneously. The presence of multiple gases can lead to competitive adsorption effects, where the sorption of one gas affects the sorption of another. This can result in different sorption behaviors compared to pure-gas scenarios. For instance, mixed-gas sorption can lead to phenomena such as plasticization or antiplasticization, which are not typically observed in pure-gas sorption [Source: Context Subquestion 1].\n\n### Dual-Mode Sorption Model for Predicting Mixed-Gas Sorption\n\nThe dual-mode sorption model (DMS) is widely used to describe gas sorption in glassy polymers. It combines two mechanisms: Henry's law for gas molecules dissolved in the polymer matrix and Langmuir-type sorption for gas molecules trapped in microvoids. The model is characterized by three parameters: the Henry's law constant (\\(k\\)), the Langmuir capacity constant (\\(C'\\)), and the Langmuir affinity constant (\\(b\\)).\n\nThe total sorption (\\(C\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ C = k \\cdot p + \\frac{C' \\cdot b \\cdot p}{1 + b \\cdot p} \\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the gas pressure. This model can be extended to mixed-gas systems by considering the competitive sorption of different gases, which affects the parameters \\(C'\\) and \\(b\\) for each gas [Source: Context Subquestion 2 and 3].\n\n### Challenges in Predicting Pure- and Mixed-Gas Sorption\n\n#### Pure-Gas Sorption\n\nAccurately predicting pure-gas sorption using the dual-mode sorption model can be challenging due to the need for precise parameter estimation. High-pressure data are critical to capture the intrinsic non-linearities of sorption isotherms, which can improve parameter inference. However, obtaining such data can be difficult and resource-intensive [Source: Context Subquestion 4].\n\n#### Mixed-Gas Sorption\n\nFor mixed-gas sorption, the challenges are more pronounced due to the complexity of competitive adsorption effects. The dual-mode sorption model often deviates from observed mixture data, making it difficult to predict mixed-gas behavior accurately. Additionally, existing measurement techniques for mixed-gas sorption are slow and material-intensive, limiting their practical application in industrial settings [Source: Context Subquestion 5].\n\nIn summary, while the dual-mode sorption model provides a useful framework for understanding gas sorption in glassy polymers, both pure- and mixed-gas sorption predictions face significant challenges due to the complexity of interactions and the need for accurate parameter estimation.",

Furthermore, we show that sorption data (e.g., high-pressure data), able to capture intrinsic isotherm nonlinearities of sorption models, are critical to considerably improve parameter inference from collective model-data fits and thus accurately predict mixture sorption. Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends inside both types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical structures. The present model can reduce the dynamic responses to the multi-component target analytes observed in the experimental signal responses. Moreover, the use of optimized fitting parameters extracted from pure vapors with viscoelastic parameters allows us to predict the concentration of each analyte in the multi-component system.\n\n## Subquestion: What challenges exist in accurately predicting mixed-gas sorption using the dual-mode sorption model?\nSearch Results:\nThe dual-mode theory became a de facto standard for the description of sorption data for glassy polymers and the combination of the three parameters has been determined for a broad range of systems. 4 A typical shape of dual-mode sorption isotherm together with the two contributions is shown in Fig. 1 (black, red, and blue solid lines).
